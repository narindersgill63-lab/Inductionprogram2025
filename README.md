# OVERALL EXPERIENCE:
### Frankly speaking about my experience,i felt mixed emotions during these days.Some lectures felt boring while some felt really interesting like the one by Dr.JASWINDER SINGH(Education Professional ,Science Communicator and Innovator).Some emotions were quite overwhelming too because obviously it takes some time to adjust.I greatly appreciate all the faculty members and my seniors who helped a lot during these days. I hope to stand confidently on the stage one day just like our dedicated seniors who are the great role models for all the newly admitted students who started onto thier B.Tech journey with faith,hope and determination.I explored the campus with my new friends which filled me with immence joy and pleasure.I also liked the fact that how students in GNDEC are encouraged to worship god and pray on regular basis for their fruitful future while respecting all the religions equally.I look forward to explore more about college and opportunities that it provides so that i can grab these opportunities and take benefit from these in building a successful life.
